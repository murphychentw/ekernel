	C++ class.

1998/12/02:
	Create new classes : GDT and Processor.

1998/12/03:
	Create new classes : IDT and TSS.

1998/12/06:
	Modify the directory structure.
	Eliminate the 'include' directory tree. Put include files along with
	their implementation files.

1998/12/08:
	Add the file coff.h defining structures about COFF file format in 
	sub-directory 'libexec'.

1998/12/09:
	Create new classes : PageDirectory and PageTable for handling paging.

1998/12/10:
	Debug PageDirectory ,PageTable, and Allocator.
	Modify coff.h and try to gather the information contained in
		COFF files.

1998/12/11:
	Add the C library function: strcpy from DJGPP-v2 source.

1998/12/14:
	Add the Array template class.
		void SetSize(int nSize);
		int GetSize() const;
		void SetAt(int nIndex, Type& tElement);
		Type GetAt(int nIndex) const;
		bool CheckValid(int nIndex);
		int FindEmptySlot();
		int Add(Type& tElement);
	Redesign the function ::CreateThread, because at this time
		the concept of process has been introduced.
	Design the function ::CreateProcessFromImage();
	Add some member function to Process class:
		void SetProcessID(dword nID);
		void MemoryAllocatorSpace(void *addr, vm_size_t size);
		void* MemoryAllocatorAlloc(vm_size_t size);
		void* PageTableGetBase();
		void PageTableInit();
		void PageTableMapRange(vm_offset_t linear_address,
			vm_offset_t physical_address, vm_size_t size, dword mapping_bits);

1998/12/26:
	Modify the context-switch related code, use hardware supported 
	task-state-segment and iretd for context switching.

1998/12/27:
	Design the system call interface.

1999/01/06:
	Design the SystemCallDispatcher class.
	Debug System Call Dispatcher via Call Gates, and test okay!
	Add codes in multi_boot_main to call global object constructors.

1999/01/31:
	Redesign the List template class.
	Add new member functions to Process class:
		void AddThread(dword nThreadID);
		void RemoveThread(dword nThreadID);

1999/02/01:
	Automatically generate dependency files for Makefile.
	Add new files: serial_io.cc serial.h for outputing messages thru RS232.

1999/03/09:
	Greatly modify the overall architecture, making it more and more portable.
